# GameOfLife
School project (5/2020)

Game of life is the simplest evolution theory model.
Each cell with one or no neighbors' dies, as if by loneliness.
Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.
Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
